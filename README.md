# Visual-Programming
This repository stores code to collect and display fixed and monthly expenses. Calulates savings and plots monthly expenses throughout the year.
This project is an Expense Tracker designed to help users manage and visualize their monthly expenses. It features a user-friendly interface divided into four interconnected windows, each serving a specific purpose:

ðŸ§¾ Window 1: Fixed Expenses Input
The first window prompts the user to enter their fixed monthly expenses such as gas, food, rent, or mortgage. These are common recurring costs that most people deal with. After entering the data and clicking "Next", the user is taken to the second window.

ðŸ“‹ Window 2: Additional Expenses & Month
This window displays the fixed expenses entered earlier and asks the user to:

Select the current month

Input any additional expenses that are not fixed, such as gifts, trips, or outings.

This data is essential for the calculations in the third window.

ðŸ“Š Window 3: Budget & Savings
Here, the user is asked:

How much money they had for the current month

What percentage of that money they aimed to save

Using all previously entered data, the application calculates:

The total amount spent

Whether the user met their savings goal

ðŸ“ˆ Window 4: Monthly Summary Visualization
The final window compiles all the collected data and generates a bar graph showing the total expenses for each month. Users can repeat this process for multiple months to track their financial progress and savings habits over time.
